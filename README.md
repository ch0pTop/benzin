# Benzin AI

Benzin AI is an advanced machine learning system specifically designed to detect and counteract KillAura cheats commonly found in clients like LiquidBounce, Rise, Sigma5, Sakura, and many other analyzing player behavior in real-time, identifying suspicious patterns and anomalies.

## Introduction

Currently, to my knowledge, there are two anti-cheats capable of detecting KillAura. The most well-known and publicly available one is Polar AntiCheat. Another anti-cheat that is claimed to be capable of detecting KillAura is Minemen's AGC. While it is often praised, it is unclear how accurate these claims are, as I have never personally tested or played on that server. However, this is what several insiders suggest.

At present, there are no open-source options that are even minimally detecting updated KillAura's. Even open-source solutions and some paid options like Spartan, which incorporate machine learning, struggle to detect KillAura effectively and are only capable of identifying basic KillAura's, such as those with simplistic rotations like aimlock with minimal randomization.

## Features


Here, I introduce a potential (I use the term potential as various aspects are still being evaluated) solution in the form of the powerful open-source, Benzin AI, which has been developed by ch0pTop.

Currently, this machine learning core is capable of detecting the KillAura of several clients with a relatively short processing time, though the required processing power is moderate. The core can currently analyze only one player at a time, but this should not be underestimated. Despite processing a small amount of samples, it produces very few false positives, which can be addressed with further training and data collection.
